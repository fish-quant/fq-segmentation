We provide several ImJoy plugins to 

* [**Pre-process 3D images**](imjoy-preprocessing.md) to obain 2D images ready for segmentation. 
* Perform [**segmentation**](imjoy-segmentation.md) of 2D images. 

Once a plugin is installed, it will be available for later use in the ImJoy **workspace `fq-segmentation`** as explained [here](tools-imjoy.md#opening-a-workspace). 

Each **workflow** is documented in a dedicated section. We provide

* **Installation links**.
* Detailed explanations of the different **parameters**.
* A **Recommended workflow** for how to set the parameters following the recommended data organization.
