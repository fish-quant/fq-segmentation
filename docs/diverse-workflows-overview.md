Here we provide a description of less frequently used workflows.  

* [**Split multi-channel images**](fiji-split-channels.md) to obain single-channel images for analysis. 
* [**Calculate distance to objects**](distance-objects.md) to calculate images summarizing which object is closest to each pixel.
* [**Convert segmentation results in FQ outlines**](create-fq-outlines.md) that can be used by the older Matlab version of FISH-quant. 

Each workflow is documented in a dedicated section.
