Here we provide a description of less frequently used workflows.  

* [**Split multi-channel images**](fiji-split-channels.md) to obain single-channel images for analysis. 
* [**Convert segmentation results in FQ outlines**](create-fq-outlines.md) that can be used by the older Matlab version of FISH-quant. 

Each workflow is documented in a dedicated section.
