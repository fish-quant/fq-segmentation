This repository provides wrapper code for the **segmentation of cells and nuclei**. 

* The actual **segmentation** is performed with the [**Cellpose package**](https://github.com/mouseland/cellpose).
* We provide **convenient wrappers** to apply this approach in a batch mode to a large number of images.
* We provide **pre- and post-processing** routines to prepare images for segmentation and extract further information, e.g. distance measurements for objects.

Most of the workflows are implemented **ImJoy plugins**, allowing to use them with minimal installation and a user-interface. 

!!! abstract "Quick summary for how to connect ImJoy to Jupyter engine"
    1. Open **anaconda terminal**. 
    2. **Activate environment**: `conda activate fq-segmentation`
    3. **Start Jupyter engine**: `imjoy --jupyter`
    4. **Connect** ImJoy to Jupyter Engine with ðŸš€ button.

Below we describe 

* How to **install & use ImJoy**. 
* How to **organize data** for best use in the provided workflows.

We also provide **Jupyter notebooks** for these workflows, which we recommend for more experienced Python users.
