Here we provide a description of less frequently used workflows.  

* [**Split multi-channel images**](workflows-fiji-split-channels.md) to obain single-channel images for analysis.
* [**Create numbered label images**](workflows-create-numbered-labels.md) to create an image with color-code segmentation masks including their identifer.
* [**Calculate distance to objects**](workflows-distance-objects.md) to calculate images summarizing which object is closest to each pixel.
* [**Convert segmentation results in FQ outlines**](workflows-create-fq-outlines.md) that can be used by the older Matlab version of FISH-quant.

Each workflow is documented in a dedicated section.
